# Naive-Bayes-Without-Libraries
In this notebook, I implemented Naive Bayes without using any predefined library for classification using Naive Bayes. The dataset is provided for which I have done the 
classification. I have replaced the class labels as positive and negative and then the code exports the prediction into a separate excel file along with all the other feature values.
